### Manual Validation Questions
*The answer after the question defines which answer indicates the presence of Bad Smell.*

**God Class**
- Does the class have more than one responsibility? *Yes*
- Does the class have functionality that would fit better into other classes? *Yes*
- Would splitting up the class improve the overall design? *Yes*

*Reference: Building Empirical Support for Automated Code Smell Detection. Jan Schumacher et al.*

**Refused Parent Bequest**
- Does the class use only a little of parent's behaviour? *Yes*
- Does the parent class provide more than a few protected members? *Yes*
- Does the class is too small/simple? *No*

*Reference: Object-Oriented Metrics in practice. Michele Lanza, Radu Marinescu. (Book)*

**Long Method**
- Does the method have many conditional branches? *Yes*
- Does the method is excessively large? *Yes*
- Does the method use many variables? *Yes*

*Reference: Object-Oriented Metrics in practice. Michele Lanza, Radu Marinescu. (Book)*

**Feature Envy**
- Does the method use directly more than a few attributes of other classes? *Yes*
- Does the method use far more attributes from other classes than its own? *Yes*
- Do the used "foreign" attributes belong to very few other classes? *Yes*
